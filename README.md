# Finance Data Comparison

## Overview

This application dashboard is designed for file upload and comparison, focusing on CSV data handling. Users can
upload internal and external CSV files, input ISIN numbers for comparison, and view the results directly on the
dashboard. The interface provides real-time status updates on file uploads, highlights matched and unmatched
entries, and offers options to resolve mismatches. The results and processing report are dynamically updated to
provide clear insights into the finance data comparison process. The dashboard uses a responsive layout with Bootstrap for a
polished and user-friendly experience.
